# Anuj Doshi

Hello! I am Anuj Doshi. I am an AI researcher, engineer and roboticist.

Brief introduction:
- I currently live in New York. I am originally from Mumbai, India.
- I'm a __part-time PhD student__ (though it doesn't feel "part-time") focusing on __Video Understanding__ at NYU with the [AI4CE group](https://ai4ce.github.io), advised by [Dr. Chen Feng](https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/chen-feng). I am in the first year of the program.  
- By day, I work on industrial AI, and semiconductor defect detection at (Nanotronics)[https://nanotronics.ai]. Most recently, I built the Gen V AI models at Nanotronics - ref: [Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240711505764/en/Nanotronics-Unveils-Groundbreaking-Gen-V-AI-Model-and-Two-New-Affordable-Inspection-Products-—-Set-to-Transform-Global-Manufacturing), [Yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nanotronics-unveils-groundbreaking-gen-v-130000159.html), [LinkedIN](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anujndoshi_nanotronics-unveils-groundbreaking-gen-v-activity-7218932431582593026-iB3i/), [Silicon Semiconductor](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://siliconsemiconductor.net/video/524/Nanotronics_unveils_Gen_V_AI_Model&ved=2ahUKEwiAnbjU9r6KAxVEGVkFHWtpJZMQtwJ6BAgFEAI&usg=AOvVaw2eAx1SZ0AYXq4KOAz3aDPu). 
- I got my master's degree in Robotics & Mechatronics from NYU. 

In my spare time, I love tinkering with open-source projects—both software and hardware. I am always “cookin’ something”. and right now I’m exploring joint embedding models.. Check out the [kitchen/warehouse](/kitchen) section to see more notebooks, experiments, and builds I’ve been working on!
